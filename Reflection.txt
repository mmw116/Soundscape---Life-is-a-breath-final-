One of the things that stayed consistent through the creation process of my soundscape, was my original idea of making it about the fleetingness of life. I knew from the beginning that I wanted it to open and close with an actual breath to represent life being short. 
In the beginning I had planned to include many more clips with lots of different phases of life. As I was working on it though I found that it was becoming too cluttered and that it may be better to take clips out so that the gaps between clips would give the listener more time process what they were hearing. The soundscape follows the life of a girl. Initially I wanted to have some bigger moments of life in it like a wedding or graduation, but I ran into a little trouble finding the right clips for the project. So, I opted to keep the clips more simple with moments like riding a bike and racing with a friend, ordering ice cream, standing under a waterfall with family, etc. I felt that the project was moving more in the direction of being about this girls life, with her family instead of it being just her. I think this made the project feel more nostalgic and sentimental for me. And if I had more time, I would want to make it even longer. I really wanted the sound to be ambient and to sound distant/echoey to be like memories dancing around in someone’s mind. I was mostly able to achieve the sound that I was going for. I think having the music playing in the background added to that. Overall I really enjoyed this project and am happy with it.
